<b>Bugs and TODO List:</b><br />
The splash screen is finished. The initial game layout and design is completed (with basic graphics for objects). 
The towers currently never stop shooting which is something i need to fix. The next step is to detect when an enemy
is in range of a tower.

<b>Inspiration:</b><br />
Create a fun application (based on a game I played as a kid), for people of all ages to play.
